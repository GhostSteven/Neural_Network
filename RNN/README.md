# RNN
## Discription
In this directory, I record some normal RNN models which include:  
1. one_layer_one_directional RNN;  
2. one_layer_bidirectional RNN;  
3. multi_layers_one_directional RNN;  
4. multi_layers_bidrectional RNN  

Each examples may contain differernt kinds of basic RNN like LSTM or GRU;  
Each examples also contain static mode and dynamic mode to be optional  
## USAGE
These examples are the most basic models. You can run any scripts with flag like `-d True` which means you want to use dynamic mode.
